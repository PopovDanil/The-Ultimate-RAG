# The-Ultimate-RAG
[S25] Software project for Innopolis University


## How to use
First, you need to install: pytorch, sentence_transformers, ctransformers, numpy, qdrant_client, nltk, langchain[docx text pdf]
Then, for only the first run, in main add:
                                system.processor.update_nltk()
In main: for path -> define a full path to the test files
After that, python will automatically install required models(it will take a lot of time and space ~10 gb)

Bless RNG, you can run it.
